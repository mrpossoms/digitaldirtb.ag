{"rating": 0.0, "state": "Michigan", "name": "Hines Parkway", "city": "Dearborn", "lat": 42.203659, "trail_id": 22942, "lon": -83.730184, "description": "The Hines Parkway exists as a flood basin of the Middle Rouge River, and Edward Hines Drive winds along the river for more than 15 miles from Dearborn in the east to Northville in the west. You'll find pretty much anything you'd want in a park here. Soccer fields, baseball diamonds, playscapes, many scenic picnic areas, open fields, paved and dirt bike trails and barbecue grills line the road, some by the river, some by lakes and some in quiet fields adorned with wild flowers and shade trees. In short, Hines is a great place to get away for leisure or recreation on a sunny spring or summer day. In the fall, a drive through Hines provides a beautiful look at southeast Michigan's autumn foliage. In the winter, the park offers sledding and skating venues as well as its annual production of the Wayne County Lightfest, one of the best holiday light displays in the Midwest.&quot;"}
