{"description": "Located outside of the town of Crockett, the 1,939 acres of Crockett Hills Regional Park were likely hunting and gathering grounds for Native Americans, later were nineteenth century ranchlands, and more recently were part of the industrial history of the region. The original ranch barn, milkhouse, and corrals can still be seen in the Crockett Ranch staging and picnic area. The park ranges in elevation from 150-800 feet, offering views of San Pablo Bay, the Delta, Mount Tamalpais, and Mount Diablo. Trails include a 4.5-mile segment of the Bay Area Ridge Trail.", "lon": -122.213427, "trail_id": 22966, "city": "Crockett", "rating": 0.0, "lat": 38.028319, "state": "California", "name": "Crockett Hills Regional Park"}
