{"rating": 5.0, "state": "Arizona", "name": "Palominas Area Trail", "city": "Hereford", "lat": 31.435452, "trail_id": 23999, "lon": -110.093048, "description": "This section of the river is usually dry in the summer, until summer monsoons replenish its banks. The roots of the larger cottonwood and willow trees are deep enough to reach the ground water, enabling them to survive the dry seasons and provide valuable habitat for a variety of species. This is the southern most section of the San Pedro Riparian National Conservation Area (NCA)."}
