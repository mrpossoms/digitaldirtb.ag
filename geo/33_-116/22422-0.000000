{"description": "The Ramona Grasslands Preserve is located in the Santa Maria Valley, situated between the coastal mesas and the mountains of the Peninsular Ranges in west-central San Diego County.  About two-thirds of what was once an extensive grassland ecosystem in the Valley has been lost to development.  The Santa Maria Valley's remaining grasslands are largely intact, though fragmented by roads and subjected to edge effects by adjacent residential and infrastructure development.", "lon": -116.950536, "trail_id": 22422, "city": "Ramona", "rating": 0.0, "lat": 33.033276, "state": "California", "name": "Ramona Grasslands Preserve"}
