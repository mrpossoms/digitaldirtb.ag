{"description": "Hurkey Creek is a popular destination for hiking and mountain biking enthusiasts and hosts two well-known mountain biking competitions each year. Though trails are limited within the park, Hurkey Creek Trail leads out the back of the park into USFS public land and other trails are a short ride or drive away. Many trails enter National Forest Wilderness, where a permit is required. Though horses are not allowed on the trails within Hurkey Creek, an equestrian trail that runs along the perimeter of the park connects with McCall Equestrian Campground less than 5 miles away.", "lon": -116.686466, "trail_id": 22467, "city": "Mountain Center", "rating": 4.33, "lat": 33.679904, "state": "California", "name": "Hurkey Creek Park"}
