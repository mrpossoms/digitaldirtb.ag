Trace State Park offers a variety of outdoor activities ranging from fishing and water sports to exploring miles of secluded nature trails. A special arrangement with the Pontotoc Country Club allows Trace State Park guests to enjoy the club's 18-hole golf course without paying green fees. Trace State Park also adds to Mississippi's History as within the park was once called home of one America's early and colorful pioneers, Davy Crockett. Crockett lived here as a horse trader with the Chickasaw Indians after his defeat for re-election to Congress in his home state of Tennessee. It was while living here he learned of his friend, Sam Houston's plight in Texas and traveled there to help and was later killed in the Battle of the Alamo."}
