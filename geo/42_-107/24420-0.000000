{"description": "Named for the green timber which covers it, Green Mountain and its neighbors, Crooks Mountain to the west and Whiskey Peak to the east, comprise a small mountain range by Rocky Mountain standards. Green Mountain has no hard rock core but was formed from sediments eroded from the much older Granite Mountains just to the north. Crooks Mountain and its adjacent Crooks Gap and Crooks Peak were named after Civil War veteran and Indian fighter General George H.
