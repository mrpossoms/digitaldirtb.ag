{"description": "The land in Lake Anna State Park used to be known as &quot;Gold Hill&quot; and contained the Goodwin Gold Mine. Gold was first discovered in 1829 with mining reaching its peak in the 1880s. In 1971 Lake Anna was created to serve as a water coolant for Dominion Power's nuclear plant. In 1972 work began on the acquisition and development of a water-oriented state park. Lake Anna State Park opened in 1983.\r\n\r\nWhile boating and fishing on this beautiful lake are major attractions, these are only some of the park's offerings. Lakefront picnic areas and wooded hiking trails are also popular. On summer weekends, interpretive programs on the nature and history of the area complement exhibits and displays in the visitor center.", "lon": -77.811928, "trail_id": 19627, "city": "Thornburg", "rating": 2.0, "lat": 38.136034, "state": "Virginia", "name": "Lake Anna State Park"}
