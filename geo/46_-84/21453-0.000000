{"rating": 0.0, "state": "Ontario", "name": "Pancake Bay Provincial Park", "city": "Batchawana Bay", "lat": 46.969008, "trail_id": 21453, "lon": -84.682122, "description": "This wide, sheltered, sandy bay on Lake Superior's east shore offers a respite for weary travellers. From a viewing platform you can see the lake and the spot where the Edmund Fitzgerald sank in a fierce November gale in 1975. Voyageurs used to stop here, with just enough flour left to make pancakes before restocking supplies in nearby Sault Ste. Marie."}
