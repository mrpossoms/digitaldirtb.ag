{"description": "Borderland State Park is an extremely historically significant landmark in Massachusetts. The park originated in the early 1900s as a home to the artist Blanche Ames and her husband Oakes, a botanist. The couple's large stone mansion and many of its furnishings remain on the property. After their deaths, the property was transformed into a beautiful state park. \r\n\r\nThe large estate is a relaxing area to horseback ride, fish, canoe, walk or in the winter months, ice-skate and sled. The park also offers tours of the home.", "lon": -71.16179, "trail_id": 1916, "city": "North Easton", "rating": 4.09, "lat": 42.060578, "state": "Massachusetts", "name": "Borderland State Park"}
