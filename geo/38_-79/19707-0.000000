{"description": "Oldest of West Virginia's state forests, Seneca borders the beautiful Greenbrier River in Pocahontas County. The forest offers pioneer guest cabins; a four(4) acre lake for trout, bass and bluegill fishing; a small campground and 11,684 acres of lush woodlands for hiking, hunting or communing with nature. The lake and forest are named after the Indian tribe which once roamed the area. Seneca's large size and modest development make it a great place to find peace and solitude.", "lon": -79.935338, "trail_id": 19707, "city": "Dunmore", "rating": 0.0, "lat": 38.32762, "state": "West Virginia", "name": "Seneca State Forest"}
