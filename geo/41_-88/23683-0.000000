{"rating": 0.0, "state": "Illinois", "name": "Herrick Lake Forest Preserve", "city": "Wheaton", "lat": 41.829474, "trail_id": 23683, "lon": -88.144791, "description": "After the retreat of the Wisconsin Glacier, the land that is now Herrick Lake Forest Preserve grew into prairies with scattered woodlands. For thousands of years, different groups of indigenous people passed through the area, some to hunt and move on, others to settle for varied periods of time. The last of these groups to call this land home was the Potawatomi, who had settled in the area by the late 1600s. Their well-traveled trails served as the basis for Butterfield and Warrenville roads."}
