South Carolina locals know the lake for its abundant population of large catfish. Santee State Park camping is offered on the lake, but for guests who prefer to spend the night indoors, rondette cabins, 10 of which sit on piers over the lake, are available and have been attracting families for years.", "lon": -80.505908, "trail_id": 19222, "city": "Santee", "rating": 2.5, "lat": 33.525347, "state": "South Carolina", "name": "Santee State Park"}
