The uplands show similarities with the plants of the Edwards Plateau to the south and west, supporting Ashe juniper, live oak, Texas red oak and Texas ash, with some post oak and mesquite and various grasses and shrubs. Trees in the bottomlands are mainly American elm, cedar elm, Texas sugarberry, burr oak and green ash. In well-watered zones along the river, the woodlands are made up of pecan, walnut, cottonwood, sycamore, black willow, and several kinds of shrubs and vines."}
