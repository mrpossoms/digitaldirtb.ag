{"description": "A complex ecosystem unfolds at this all-season park on a seven-kilometre stretch of coast on Lake Huron. Guided walks by the shore and through silver maple swamps, cattail marshes, ponds, fens and bogs reveal unusual inhabitants. Carnivorous (meat-eating) plants make this their home. Rare dwarf lake iris and the elusive spotted turtle appear in the spring. Migrating birds, including the black-crowned night heron and the American egret, stop here to snack. Winter visitors can camp in yurts and cross-country ski.", "lon": -81.454315, "trail_id": 21432, "city": "Saugeen Shores", "rating": 0.0, "lat": 44.414526, "state": "Ontario", "name": "MacGregor Point Provincial Park"}
