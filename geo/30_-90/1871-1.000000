The lake is a common sail boat area and the warm beach provides a comfortable location for visitors to sunbathe. An old railroad track that runs through the park has been converted to a hiking and cycling trail called the Tammany Trace. \r\n\r\nThere are rentable cabins on the property for upscale camping and there are a total of 160 (approx.) campsites varying in level of accessibility. \r\n\r\nA water playground is open from April to September for children."}
