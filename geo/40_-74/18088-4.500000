{"rating": 4.5, "state": "New Jersey", "name": "Cheesequake State Park", "city": "Matawan", "lat": 40.439196, "trail_id": 18088, "lon": -74.263205, "description": "Cheesequake State Park's uniqueness lies in its geographical location. Not only is it situated in the middle of the urban north and the suburban south, it lies in a transitional zone between two different ecosystems. Open fields, saltwater and freshwater marshes, a white cedar swamp, Pine Barrens, and a northeastern hardwood forest are the main characteristics of the park."}
