{"rating": 3.0, "state": "New Mexico", "name": "Glade Run Recreation Area", "city": "Farmington", "lat": 34.522869, "trail_id": 24145, "lon": -105.817375, "description": "A great spot for the weekend warrior, the Glade Run Recreation Area is comprised of 19,000 acres of sandy arroyos, slick rock and rolling terrain. Vegetation is sparse, primarily consisting of common grasses, rabbitbrush, sagebrush, junipers, and pinyons. The recreation area is split into two off-highway vehicle use zones. The northern three-quarters of the Glade are managed for limited trail use and 3,800 acres on the south end are managed as an open OHV area. Approximately 42 miles of marked trails for motorized trail bike and mountain bike riders are located in the limited OHV portion of the Glade. Challenging slick rock and wide sandy washes provide fun for off road enthusiasts in the open OHV section."}
