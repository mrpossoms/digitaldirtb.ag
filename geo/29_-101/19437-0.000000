{"description": "Seminole Canyon is still being created--deepened and widened year after year. The erosive forces of rain and flood continue to expose rock deposited up to 100 million years ago, during the Age of Dinosaurs. Ancient inland seas repeatedly flooded the landscape and then withdrew, laying down alternate bands of clay from the land and lime from the ocean. This process resulted in the layer cake of rock sequences visible today. Visitors enjoy hiking, mountain biking, camping, historical study, and nature viewing. Fate Bell Shelter, in the canyon, contains some of North America's oldest Native American pictographs and is one of the oldest cave dwellings in North America. Note:  No hiking is allowed in the canyon area without a guide (Contact the park for more information.)", "lon": -101.315699, "trail_id": 19437, "city": "Comstock", "rating": 0.0, "lat": 29.702071, "state": "Texas", "name": "Seminole Canyon State Park &amp; Historic Site"}
