{"rating": 3.44, "state": "Georgia", "name": "Hard Labor Creek State Park", "city": "Rutledge", "lat": 33.663211, "trail_id": 16202, "lon": -83.613167, "description": "While this park may be best known for its golf course, it also offers a wide range of recreational opportunities in a beautiful wooded setting. A lakeside beach is popular with swimmers during summer months, and more than 24 miles of trails are available for hikers and horseback riders.  Horse owners even have their own private camping area near stalls. Other overnight guests can choose from fully equipped cottages or a modern campground.  With so many ways to relax, it is ironic that the park's name is thought to come from slaves who tilled summer fields or American Indians who found the creek difficult to cross."}
