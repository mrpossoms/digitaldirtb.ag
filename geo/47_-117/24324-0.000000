{"rating": 0.0, "state": "Washington", "name": "Hog Canyon Lake", "city": "Spokane", "lat": 47.65878, "trail_id": 24324, "lon": -117.426047, "description": "The site is located within the BLM Fishtrap area and is open year-round. Recreation opportunities include boating, winter-only trout fishing, hiking, and horseback riding. Horseback riding typically starts from the Farmer's Landing parking lot along the access road south of the BLM ranch house (see site map). The entire water surface area of the lake is open for public use, but portions of the shoreline are privately owned. Refer to the map for shoreline private land boundaries and BLM public lands boundaries. The boat launch and all on-water recreation activities are administered by Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife (WDFW). A WDFW permit is required to park in the parking lot. Please refer to Washington fishing and hunting regulations. No additional fees are charged by BLM. There are several non-motorized use trails at the site including the 1.3-mile Hog Lake Loop Trail which starts at the small BLM parking lot mid-way down the Hog Canyon Lake access road. Although slightly set back from the lake, the trail parallels the lake's west side, with easy off-trail access to overlooks of the lake."}
