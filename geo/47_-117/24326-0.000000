{"description": "Juniper Dunes consists of three adjoining areas comprising a total of approximately 19,600 acres.  Outside of the wilderness area, the primary recreational activity at Juniper Dunes is OHV use in the &quot;Open&quot; area. Other associated uses include picnicking and camping, and some hiking, horseback riding, and hunting are done as well. Helmets, safety flags on whip masts, and current state registration and tabs/stickers are required on all OHVs. Although Juniper Dunes is open to the public, portions of Peterson Road (the only access road into the area) are privately owned. Public access is contingent on the willingness of adjacent landowners to permit the public to cross their property to reach the BLM public lands. The BLM, Franklin County, and various other partners are working to establish formal public access into Juniper Dunes.", "lon": -117.426047, "trail_id": 24326, "city": "Spokane", "rating": 0.0, "lat": 47.65878, "state": "Washington", "name": "Juniper Dunes"}
