{"description": "Glenrock embraces the last surviving pocket of coastal rainforest in the region, home to a range of animals, like bandicoots, bats and gliders. It also protects a number of ancient Aboriginal sites. One of the city's most popular beaches lies within the park's boundaries, but there is much more here than sand and surf. Take your mountain bike and explore the scenic cycling trails, walk the rainforest and waterfall tracks, launch a hang glider off the cliffs or enjoy a spot of fishing.", "lon": -105.872226, "trail_id": 22687, "city": "Newcastle", "rating": 0.0, "lat": 42.861355, "state": "New South Wales", "name": "Glenrock State Conservation Area"}
