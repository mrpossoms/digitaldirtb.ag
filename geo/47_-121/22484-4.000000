{"description": "Tolt-MacDonald offers three miles of forested and riverside trails and is a favorite mountain biking destination. The backcountry area of the park is located on the west side of the river across the suspension bridge. In addition to the trails within the park, an extensive network of single track trails in the adjacent Ames Lake Forest (managed by Port Blakely) can be accessed from Tolt-MacDonald. And if you want a bicycle tour of local farms and forests, head east from the park along the Tolt River to access the 27-mile Snoqualmie Valley Trail.", "lon": -121.926032, "trail_id": 22484, "city": "Seattle", "rating": 4.0, "lat": 47.649476, "state": "Washington", "name": "Tolt-MacDonald Park"}
