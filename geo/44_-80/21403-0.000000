{"description": "Craigleith is a beautiful park located right on the Georgian Bay and at the base of Collingwood's Blue Mountain. The shore is made from fractured plates of shale that contain invertebrate fossils from 455 million years ago. They allow hiking, swimming, boating, fishing, and biking in that area, so get out there because you never know what you'll find.", "lon": -80.371242, "trail_id": 21403, "city": "Blue Mountains", "rating": 0.0, "lat": 44.536504, "state": "Ontario", "name": "Craigleith"}
