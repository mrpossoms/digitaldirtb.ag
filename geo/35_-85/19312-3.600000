{"description": "The 1,200-acre Harrison Bay State Park, with approximately 40 miles of Chickamauga Lake shoreline, was originally developed as a Tennessee Valley Authority recreation demonstration area in the 1930's. Its name is derived from a large bay at the main channel of the Tennessee River that covers the old town of Harrison, and the last Cherokee Campground. The parklands are of historic significance because the Cherokee Campground consisted of three villages which were ruled by one of the last great Cherokee Chieftains, Chief Joe Vann. This beautiful wooded park is a haven for campers, boaters and fishermen, as well as picnickers and other day-use visitors from Chattanooga and the surrounding tri-state area.", "lon": -85.114242, "trail_id": 19312, "city": "Harrison", "rating": 3.6, "lat": 35.177992, "state": "Tennessee", "name": "Harrison Bay State Park"}
