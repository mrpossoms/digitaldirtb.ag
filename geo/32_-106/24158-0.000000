{"rating": 0.0, "state": "New Mexico", "name": "Sierra Vista Trail", "city": "Las Cruces", "lat": 32.31994, "trail_id": 24158, "lon": -106.763654, "description": "The Sierra Vista Trail is a 29-mile National Recreation Trail.  It is a nonmotorized recreation trail along the western flank of the Organ Mountains and the eastern side of the Franklin Mountains.  The trail provides spectacular views of the mountains, which jut majestically above the desert floor.  It is also possible to see wildlife, including mule deer and coyotes, along the trail.  The trail connects to the Franklin Mountain State Park Trail system in Texas, and it is used primarily by mountain bikers. While most of the trail is on gravelly uplands, some of the middle sections near Vado are very sandy and difficult for mountain bikes.  There are also rugged rocky sections where suspension is desirable on mountain bikes."}
