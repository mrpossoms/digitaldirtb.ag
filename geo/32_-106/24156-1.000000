{"description": "Picacho Peak is a 4959-foot high peak just northwest of Las Cruces. It is a volcanic mountain composed of rhyolite (mostly quartz and feldspar) that solidified at the surface approximately 35 million years ago. The recreation area has over 15 miles of mountain biking, hiking, and equestrian trails. The 1.5 mile trail to the peak provides spectacular views of the Mesilla Valley and the Organ Mountains. Although most of the recreational use occurs on the peak, there are also large canyons and mesa tops to explore.", "lon": -106.763654, "trail_id": 24156, "city": "Las Cruces", "rating": 1.0, "lat": 32.31994, "state": "New Mexico", "name": "Picacho Peak Recreation Area"}
