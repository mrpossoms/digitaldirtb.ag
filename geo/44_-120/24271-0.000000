{"description": "The Lower Deschutes River is Central Oregon's playground. From white water rafting and swimming to hiking and biking, you'll find an ideal location for outdoor sports. Follow the Lower Deschutes River Back Country Byway along the river to campgrounds at Beavertail and Macks Canyon, or the accessible fishing ramp at Blue Hole. Then visit Sherars Falls, where Native Americans still fish the traditional way, leaning from tall platforms over the river to dipnet steelhead salmon. The river is very popular and crowded during summer weekends, so arrive early to get a campsite.", "lon": -120.834466, "trail_id": 24271, "city": "Prineville", "rating": 0.0, "lat": 44.299849, "state": "Oregon", "name": "Lower Deschutes Wild and Scenic River"}
