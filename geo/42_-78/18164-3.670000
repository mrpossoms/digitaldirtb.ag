{"description": "The Quaker area is known for its two lakes and wonderful camping experiences. It offers a sandy beach for swimming, two fishing piers and a canoeing or kayaking access point. Friend's Boat Launch makes the Allegany Reservoir available to the boating enthusiasts. The many hiking trails give opportunities to explore the naturally formed caves, plus the diversity of plants and wildlife. Many come to relax with the programs offered at the Quaker amphitheater, by picnicking, or just letting the children spend time on the playground. If you enjoy sports, you can use our horse shoe pits, baseball fields, basketball, volley ball or tennis courts. The old Quaker store has been completely restored and now houses a park museum. Interesting exhibits document the history of Allegany State Park as &quot;The wilderness Playground of Western New York&quot;, and orient visitors to the parks unique features and attractions, both past and present. Allegany's mixed hemlock /hardwood forest, mountains, rolling hills and meadows, streams, ponds and lakes attract devoted outdoors enthusiasts year-round.", "lon": -78.022202, "trail_id": 18164, "city": "Salamanca", "rating": 3.67, "lat": 42.312224, "state": "New York", "name": "Allegany State Park - Quaker Area"}
