{"description": "Deer Lakes Park is a good illustration of the development of natural assets into a specific park idea. Deer Lakes already had a large man-made lake that was used for fishing, and during its development that lake was improved and two other lakes added, all using the same water-shed and leading one to the other. The lakes are spring fed, and construction of dams and new settling basins have made the site a paradise for fishermen. Additional facilities include a ballfield, a children's play area, shelters, a spray park, disc golf course and observatory.", "lon": -79.759771, "trail_id": 23449, "city": "Tarentum", "rating": 3.6, "lat": 40.601456, "state": "Pennsylvania", "name": "Deer Lakes Park"}
