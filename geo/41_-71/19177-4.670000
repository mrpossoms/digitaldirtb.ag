{"description": "Nestled between routes 146 and routes 123 , Lincoln Woods State Park is one of Blackstone Valley's great treasures. A short ride from Providence, Pawtucket, and Cumberland, it is a popular get away for northeastern Rhode Islanders. Visitors can enjoy swimming at the fresh water beach, trout fishing, playing ball, hiking, jogging, horseback riding, or just relaxing under a shade tree. A new covered bridge at the Breakneck Hill entrance has been dedicated in the spring of 2005. Lincoln Woods State Park is one of three Rhode Island State Park locations tested for safe ice during the winter months.", "lon": -71.426286, "trail_id": 19177, "city": "Lincoln", "rating": 4.67, "lat": 41.90527, "state": "Rhode Island", "name": "Lincoln Woods State Park"}
