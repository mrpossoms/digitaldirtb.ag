{"description": "Deep in the Appomattox-Buckingham State Forest, Holliday Lake is a paradise for the outdoor enthusiast. Fishing for largemouth bass, crappie and bluegill is popular. A nearby Virginia Department of Game and Inland Fisheries delayed-harvest trout stream allows anglers to fish for brown and rainbow trout. Swimming at the park's guarded beach and the &quot;Critter Hole&quot; play area are visitor favorites. The park has several hiking trails, including a connector trail to the 10.2-mile Carter Taylor Multi-use Trail for hikers, bicyclists and horseback riders. Visitors enjoy its campground, picnic shelters, playgrounds, seasonal concession stand, gift shop and boat ramp. The park rents canoes, kayaks and paddleboats. Holliday Lake is just minutes from the famous Appomattox Court House National Historical Park where Gen. Robert E. Lee surrendered to Gen. Ulysses S. Grant in 1865.", "lon": -78.640831, "trail_id": 19623, "city": "Appomattox", "rating": 0.0, "lat": 37.397239, "state": "Virginia", "name": "Holliday Lake State Park"}
