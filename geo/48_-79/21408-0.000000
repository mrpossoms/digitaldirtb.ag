{"rating": 0.0, "state": "Ontario", "name": "Esker Lakes Provincial Park", "city": "Kirkland Lake", "lat": 48.290333, "trail_id": 21408, "lon": -79.870263, "description": "Straddling the great continental divide between Arctic and Atlantic watersheds, this park preserves the legacy of glaciers that retreated 10,000 years ago - dozens of kettle lakes, part of the famous 250-kilometre Munroe esker, undulating hills and sand dunes. Now cloaked in forest, this fascinating landscape can be intimately explored along a network of hiking trails."}
