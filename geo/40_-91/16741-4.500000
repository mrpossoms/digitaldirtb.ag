{"rating": 4.5, "state": "Iowa", "name": "Geode State Park", "city": "Danville", "lat": 40.824682, "trail_id": 16741, "lon": -91.379849, "description": "&quot;Hey! Come on, we're going out to Geode!&quot; This is repeated time after time in southeast Iowa as families and friends pack picnic baskets and swimsuits and head for a fun day in the sun at one of southeast Iowa's most popular state parks. The geode stone for which this park is named brings &quot;rock hounds&quot; to the area in search of this elusive prize. A display of geodes, with mysterious crystal formations in their hollow cavities, can be seen at the park office. Please remember that it is illegal to remove geodes and other natural materials from state parks, except for mushrooms, nuts, fruits and berries."}
