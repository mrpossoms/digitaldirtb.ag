{"description": "The area includes two distinct landforms: Horse Ridge - a series of prominent fault-bounded ridges roughly parallel to State Highway 20 - and the Skeleton Fire area, a generally flat, yet rocky area located to the northwest. Horse Ridge rises to an elevation of approximately 4,700 feet and includes an ungrazed, 600-acre Research Natural Area established in 1967 as a research and study plot for western juniper big sagebrush plant communities. (See sidebar for additional information). The adjacent Skeleton Fire area has few mature juniper trees, a result of the 1996 fire which burned 17,000 acres and damaged or destroyed 30 homes. Today, one can see the effects of the fire in the diverse shrubs and native grasses in this basaltic expanse.", "lon": -121.31531, "trail_id": 24267, "city": "Bend", "rating": 4.0, "lat": 44.058173, "state": "Oregon", "name": "Horse Ridge Recreation Area"}
