{"description": "This park is a 300-acre Civil War historic site where a ragtag group of 700 Confederate old men and young boys beat the odds and held off an assault by 5,000 Union cavalry on a bridge of strategic importance to Gen. Lee's army, then under siege in Petersburg. Visit the Confederate earthworks and walk the historic bridge trail. Two visitor centers feature 2,300 square feet of exhibits on the area's rich Civil War heritage, Native American archaeological investigations and electric energy production. The park includes a 1.2-mile self-guided trail through the battlefield and a three-quarter-mile nature trail with two wildlife observation towers overlooking wetlands.", "lon": -78.703148, "trail_id": 19640, "city": "Randolph", "rating": 0.0, "lat": 36.881149, "state": "Virginia", "name": "Staunton River Battlefield State Park"}
