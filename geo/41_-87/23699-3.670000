{"description": "The 2,492-acre Waterfall Glen Forest Preserve in Darien is one of the most ecologically impressive parcels of open space within the Forest Preserve District of DuPage County, if not northern Illinois. The ridges and scattered potholes that make up the topography of Waterfall Glen - and most of the county - are the result of one geological event, the Wisconsin Glacier. In fact, the entire Des Plaines River Valley was formed by glacial meltwaters and drainage from a postglacial lake that covered most of the Chicagoland area.", "lon": -87.987624, "trail_id": 23699, "city": "Darien", "rating": 3.67, "lat": 41.697002, "state": "Illinois", "name": "Waterfall Glen Forest Preserve"}
