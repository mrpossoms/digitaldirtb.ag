On one hand, there's the largest manmade lake in the state, Lake Norman. When filled to capacity, its surface area is 32,510 acres with a shoreline of 520 miles and a main channel 34 miles in length ? thus its nickname, the &quot;Inland Sea.&quot; Thirteen miles of the shoreline are in the state park, which provides boating access."}
