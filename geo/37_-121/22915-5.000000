The park is the site of over 135 years of mining activities and former home to more than 1,800 miners and their families. The park encompasses 4,152 acres, occupying a majority of Capitancillos Ridge. During early spring, the park offers one of the most spectacular wildflower displays in the region. Remnants of the mining era also offer an exciting look into the mining operations of the latter part of the 19th century."}
