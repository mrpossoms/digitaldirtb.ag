{"rating": 0.0, "state": "California", "name": "Alviso Marina County Park", "city": "Alviso", "lat": 37.427296, "trail_id": 22916, "lon": -121.978889, "description": "This 18.9-acre bayside park, though small in size, offers a great deal of activities within its boundaries and on into the Wildlife Refuge. Both the pathways and boardwalks of the County Park and trails around the ponds in the adjacent Wildlife Refuge offer fantastic views of the mountains surrounding the bay, and of the wildlife that call these ponds home."}
