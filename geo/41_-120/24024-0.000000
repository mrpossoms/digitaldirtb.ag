{"rating": 0.0, "state": "California", "name": "Lava Wilderness Study Area", "city": "Alturas", "lat": 41.487115, "trail_id": 24024, "lon": -120.542456, "description": "These stark and barren landscapes are testaments to the power of volcanic forces. Rugged volcanic formations, including islands, fissures, and domes, checker the landscape. Many of the domes are lava tubes or caves; other domes have collapsed, forming interesting profiles and minature valleys. The visitor can see and learn first hand about the forces that melted and twisted rock. Although there are no identified trail heads, access points can be found on the Modoc Country Map (or call the Alturas Field Office for exact locations)."}
