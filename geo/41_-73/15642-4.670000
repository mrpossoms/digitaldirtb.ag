Waldo State Park", "city": "Southbury", "lat": 41.464325, "trail_id": 15642, "lon": -73.285741, "description": "George Waldo State Park enjoys 150 acres of undeveloped, topographically diverse land in southwest Connecticut.  A trail of about 7/10 mile leads from Purchase Brook Road to the shore of Lake Lillinonah, drops 140 feet across its length and passes through mixed deciduous and coniferous total forest cover to the water's edge.  Look for wetlands by the trailhead and stone walls away from the trail."}
