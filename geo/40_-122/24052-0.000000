{"rating": 0.0, "state": "California", "name": "Pit River Recreation Area", "city": "Redding", "lat": 40.58654, "trail_id": 24052, "lon": -122.391675, "description": "The Pit River is the largest river in Northeastern California. It drains this part of the state before entering the Sacramento River at Shasta Lake. The north fork of the Pit starts at Goose Lake, while the south fork begins high in the Warner Mountains. The two converge near Alturas, California. The river flows through large mountain valleys and cuts its way through massive basalt flows to form incredible canyons. These canyons exhibit unusual geological formations that promote a variety of wildlife species unique to these landscapes."}
