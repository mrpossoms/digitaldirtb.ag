{"rating": 3.0, "state": "Massachusetts", "name": "Bradley Palmer State Park", "city": "Hamilton", "lat": 42.636205, "trail_id": 25162, "lon": -70.843105, "description": "Bradley Palmer State Park is a Massachusetts state park located in the towns of Hamilton and Topsfield. The park is managed by the Department of Conservation and Recreation. The park is based on a former estate willed to the state expressly for the use of its citizens on the death of its owner, Bradley Palmer. The Bradley Palmer mansion, former host to secret or high-level government conferences in the FDR era, has been restored by the state and may be rented for private functions. The former barn and garage facilities have been turned into a headquarters and maintenance center. Also on the grounds is a colonial farmhouse currently being restored and a caretaker's house. Entrance to the park is through the north gate; the old south gate is permanently closed. Through traffic is not allowed. Near the south gate a wading pool with overhead fountain has been constructed. It has an entrance fee, the only one in the park. A connecting paved road runs through the park."}
