{"description": "Hill Country State Natural Area is a scenic mosaic of rocky hills, flowing springs, oak groves, grasslands and canyons. The terrain ranges from flat, broad creek bottoms to steep, rocky canyons up to 2,000 feet in elevation. The West Verde Creek has several spring-fed streams, and tanks in the park provide several swimming holes with limited fishing for catfish, perch and largemouth bass. Spring water is available for horses, but people should bring their own drinking water.", "lon": -99.191051, "trail_id": 19388, "city": "Bandera", "rating": 0.0, "lat": 29.627745, "state": "Texas", "name": "Hill Country State Natural Area"}
