{"description": "A linear day use park over one mile long situated in the mouth of Santa Ana Canyon in the city of Anaheim. The linear environment of the park site recaptures the river setting of the adjacent Santa Ana River. Because the park is in a historic setting in an area where such names as Yorba, Peralta and Dominguez were common, the Orange County Board of Supervisors recognized the 1976 opening of the park site by designating Yorba Regional Park as the official Orange County bicentennial project. Facilities include trails, playgrounds, volleyball courts, baseball fields, a physical fitness course, 200 barbeques and 400 picnic tables.", "lon": -117.770712, "trail_id": 22449, "city": "Anaheim", "rating": 2.0, "lat": 33.865944, "state": "California", "name": "Yorba Regional Park"}
