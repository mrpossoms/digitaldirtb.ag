{"rating": 1.0, "state": "New Mexico", "name": "Ignacio Chavez Special Management Area", "city": "Bernalillo", "lat": 35.30004, "trail_id": 24166, "lon": -106.551137, "description": "The Ignacio Chavez Special Management Area (SMA) consists primarily of two Wilderness Study Areas -- the Ignacio Chavez Wilderness Study Area (33,300 acres) and the Chamisa Wilderness Study Area (13,700 acres). Steep canyons and high rugged cliffs provide rewarding challenges for the backcountry hiker here. Much of the Special Management Area lies within the Ignacio Chavez Land Grant, awarded to settlers in 1768 by the Spanish government for establishing communities. Because these communities were never developed, the U.S. Government later acquired the land grant."}
