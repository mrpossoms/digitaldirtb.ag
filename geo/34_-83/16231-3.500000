{"rating": 3.5, "state": "Georgia", "name": "Smithgall Woods State Park", "city": "Helen", "lat": 34.69085, "trail_id": 16231, "lon": -83.767335, "description": "Smithgall Woods is an angler's paradise. One of north Georgia's premier trout streams, Dukes Creek, runs through this spectacular mountain property and is a favorite for catch-and-release fishing. To ensure a quality experience, the number of anglers is limited and fishing is offered only on certain days.  As a result, anglers should call ahead for reservations. Five miles of trails and 18 miles of roads allow hikers and bicyclists to explore hardwoods, streams and wildlife."}
