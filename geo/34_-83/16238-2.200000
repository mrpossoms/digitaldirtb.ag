{"rating": 2.2, "state": "Georgia", "name": "Victoria Bryant State Park", "city": "Royston", "lat": 34.300312, "trail_id": 16238, "lon": -83.159159, "description": "Nestled in the rolling hills of Georgia's upper Piedmont, this is one of northern Georgia's best kept secrets. A beautiful stream flows through the park, providing the perfect setting for an after-picnic stroll. Hikers can follow either the short nature trail or the longer perimeter trail that travels through hardwoods and crosses creeks. Animal lovers should keep an eye out for wildlife while passing food plots along the perimeter trail. Two small ponds are open for public fishing, and a swimming pool is open during summer. Campers can stay overnight in the small, comfortable campground."}
