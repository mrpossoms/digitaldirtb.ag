{"description": "One of the most picturesque state parks in Georgia, Watson Mill Bridge contains the longest covered bridge in the state, spanning 229 feet across the South Fork River. Built in 1885 by Washington (W.W.) King, son of freed slave and famous covered-bridge builder Horace King, the bridge is supported by a town lattice truss system held firmly together with wooden pins.  At one time, Georgia had more than 200 covered bridges; today, less than 20 remain.", "lon": -83.079929, "trail_id": 16240, "city": "Comer", "rating": 3.0, "lat": 34.023016, "state": "Georgia", "name": "Watson Mill Bridge State Park"}
