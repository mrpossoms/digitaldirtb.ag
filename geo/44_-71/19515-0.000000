{"rating": 0.0, "state": "Vermont", "name": "Maidstone State Park", "city": "Maidstone", "lat": 44.65307, "trail_id": 19515, "lon": -71.638752, "description": "Maidstone is the most remote of Vermont's state parks and still retains much of the wilderness character associated with the Northeast Kingdom. Maidstone Lake was created when glacial ice carved out a deep basin in a preexisting valley. When the last glaciers melted 12,000 years ago, a deep, clear, cold lake was formed."}
