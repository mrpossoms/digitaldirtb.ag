{"description": "Visitors to this 500-acre regional park have quite a palette of activities to choose from. The Summit Site, atop a hill overlooking the Sweetwater Valley, offers modern campsites - including some with corrals for equestrians who want to bring their horses and explore the miles of trails in the area. Below the summit are hundreds of acres of stream side vegetation, grassland, and open areas that provide a variety of habitats for hikers, horseback riders, and mountain bikers. Campers, trailers, motor homes, and tent camping are all options at the sites, all of which have water and electricity. Trailers as long as 45 feet will find plenty of room here. Hot showers are available for all campers. One of the major attractions at the park is the pavilion. This covered structure and its kitchen facilities are especially suited for group campers. An adjacent local park features a lawn area, tot lot, splash park and shaded picnic tables with panoramic views of the countryside.
