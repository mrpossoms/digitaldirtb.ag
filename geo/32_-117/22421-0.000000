{"rating": 0.0, "state": "California", "name": "Otay Valley Regional Park", "city": "San Diego", "lat": 32.59026, "trail_id": 22421, "lon": -117.061956, "description": "The Otay Valley Regional Park represents one of the major open space areas within the southern area of San Diego County, linking south San Diego Bay with lower Otay Lake. It will provide South Bay residents and visitors recreational opportunities ranging from playing fields and picnic areas to hiking, biking, and horse trails. At the same time, the park will protect open space, wildlife, historic, agricultural, and archaeological resources. Currently there are no active or passive recreational areas in the park, other than the County-owned and operated facility at Otay Lakes. However, there are plans for multi-use areas and an extensive trail system within the park's boundaries, and the various jurisdictional agencies are now actively pursuing land acquisition for the park."}
