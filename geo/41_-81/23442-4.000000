{"description": "Mill Stream Run Reservation is located in Berea, Middleburg Heights, North Royalton and Strongsville. Long ago nineteenth century communities like Albion, Sanderson's Corners and Slab Hollow sprang up to take advantage of the water power from the east branch of the Rocky River and its tributaries. After the sawmills and grist mills were established, businesses like a basket factory, taverns, blacksmith shops and tailors followed. At Berea, the river cuts through Berea sandstone carving potholes in the stone. Baldwin and Wallace lakes are former quarries that produced some of the finest grindstones in the world. The settlers were not the first to visit; artifacts have been found in the reservation that indicate Native American tribes frequented this area over 8,000 years ago. The reservation includes numerous species of wildlife and plant life, including ferns and wildflowers. The East Branch of the Rocky River is noted for its spring trout fishing. The reservation also has a number of trails and picnic areas for visitors to enjoy year round, including the Chalet with its twin toboggan chutes for winter thrills, summer reserved picnicking and fall hayrides.", "lon": -81.796602, "trail_id": 23442, "city": "Berea", "rating": 4.0, "lat": 41.307805, "state": "Ohio", "name": "Mill Stream Run Reservation"}
