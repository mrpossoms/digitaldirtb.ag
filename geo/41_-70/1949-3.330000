{"rating": 3.33, "state": "Massachusetts", "name": "Nickerson State Park", "city": "Brewster", "lat": 41.739734, "trail_id": 1949, "lon": -70.018715, "description": "Nickerson State Park is a beautifully wooded area, unusually close to Cape Cod. The landscape is different from what is normally associated with the area. Eight kettle ponds are located on the property, making fishing and canoeing popular. Several paths that winds through the park are open to mountain bikers, hikers, cross country skiers and horseback riders.\r\n\r\n  The park's 1,900 acres offer over 400 campsites, a yurt camping area, an amphitheater, eight miles of roads and multi-use trails and an eight mile bike path that connects to the 22 mile Cape Cod Rail Trail. The park is an excellent recreational area."}
