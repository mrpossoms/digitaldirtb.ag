Riders can start either on the lower or upper end and make a loop ride, an out-and-back ride on a two-track road, or arrange a shuttle back to the vehicle. If you are planning a loop or out-and-back ride, you'll have some climbing to enjoy. Vegetation includes sagebrush, serviceberry, aspen, and limber pine. Opportunities to view antelope, deer, elk and raptors exist."}
