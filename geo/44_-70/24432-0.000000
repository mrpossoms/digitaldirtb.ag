{"description": "This route uses a combination of improved dirt/graveled and two-track roads. Riders can start either on the lower or upper end and make a loop ride, an out-and-back ride on a two-track road, or arrange a shuttle back to the vehicle. If you are planning a loop or out-and-back ride, you'll have some climbing to enjoy. Vegetation includes sagebrush, serviceberry, aspen, and limber pine. Opportunities to view antelope, deer, elk and raptors exist.", "lon": -70.368142, "trail_id": 24432, "city": "Dad", "rating": 0.0, "lat": 44.114197, "state": "Wyoming", "name": "Deep Gulch"}
