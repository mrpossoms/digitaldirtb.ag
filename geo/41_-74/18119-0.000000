The view encompasses the pastoral farmland of New Jersey to the east and undeveloped forests and mountain ridges to the west. For those who don't relish the idea of climbing up the side of a mountain and following a sometimes rocky and steep trail for a few hours, there is a short drive to the pavilion at the top of the mountain."}
