{"rating": 0.0, "state": "Texas", "name": "Mustang Island State Park", "city": "Port Aransas", "lat": 27.687309, "trail_id": 19423, "lon": -97.178145, "description": "Mustang Island is a coastal barrier island with a unique and complicated ecosystem dependent upon sand dunes. Coastal dunes are the product of wind-deposited sand anchored by sparse mats of vegetation. The height of well-vegetated dunes may reach 35 feet, though 15-20 feet is average. The dunes are capable of reducing the destructive might of hurricane-driven waves and protecting bay and mainland areas. In some areas, inland and bayside dunes occur, which are generally smaller but spread over larger areas than the primary beachside dunes. The vegetation holding the dunes in place is comprised of drought-resistant species such as sea oats, beach panic grass and soilbind morning glory. Studies have shown that these plants and their progeny can collect enough sand to build a 15-foot dune in three years."}
