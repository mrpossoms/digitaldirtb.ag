{"rating": 0.0, "state": "Arizona", "name": "Mohave &amp; Milltown Railroad Trail", "city": "Oatman", "lat": 34.994069, "trail_id": 23979, "lon": -114.440711, "description": "The M&amp;M Railroad Trails are intertwined as they follow the route of an historic railroad grade.  Hikers and mountain bikers travel along the actual railroad grade for most of the way, although detours are sometimes necessary where the grade has washed away from flooding.  OHV and equestrian users follow a route which does not lie on the grade, but parallels and frequently crosses the railroad bed.  Both routes are marked with signs and rock cairns to keep visitors on course."}
