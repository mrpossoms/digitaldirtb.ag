Bong, a Poplar, WI native who was America's leading air ace during World War II. The air base was abandoned three days before concrete was to be poured for a 12,500-foot runway. Local citizens had the foresight to protect this open space for future generations.", "lon": -88.127133, "trail_id": 19786, "city": "Kansasville", "rating": 1.0, "lat": 42.636306, "state": "Wisconsin", "name": "Richard Bong State Recreation Area"}
