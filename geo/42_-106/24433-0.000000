{"description": "This area consists of roads that start in the sagebrush flats and climb among the pine, fir, and aspen. Choose a variety of road surfaces from maintained graveled to undeveloped two-tracks. Wildlife viewing of deer, elk, and antelope is common. Some private land is on the mountain so ask permission before riding off of public roads. Also, there may be active logging operations on the mountain so be alert for equipment and logging trucks.", "lon": -106.597532, "trail_id": 24433, "city": "Medicine Bow", "rating": 0.0, "lat": 42.106906, "state": "Wyoming", "name": "Shirley Mountains"}
