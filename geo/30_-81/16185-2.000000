{"rating": 2.0, "state": "Georgia", "name": "Crooked River State Park", "city": "St. Marys", "lat": 30.842206, "trail_id": 16185, "lon": -81.55247, "description": "Located on southern tip of Georgia's Colonial Coast, this park is the perfect spot for enjoying the intracoastal waterway and maritime forest.  Campsites are surrounded by palmettos and Spanish moss-draped oaks, while cottages are set near the tidal river.  A boat ramp is popular with anglers who often take to the water before sunrise.  Just down the road is the ferry to famous Cumberland Island National Seashore known for secluded beaches and wild horses."}
