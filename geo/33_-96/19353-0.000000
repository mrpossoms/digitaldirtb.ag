{"description": "The park is situated in the Blackland Prairies region of Texas. The terrain is dominated by grassland interspersed by woodlands. More luxuriant woodlands occur along water courses and the lake's shoreline. Although the park's grasslands are no longer pristine, they are recovering nicely and have small areas dominated by little bluestem and bushy bluestem. The woodlands are composed of Texas oak, eastern red cedar, bois d'arc and eve's necklace, with sugarberry, cottonwood, black willow and green ash becoming more common along the creeks and lakeshore. Numerous wildflowers and flowering shrubs cover the gently rolling prairie in the spring, and stands of cedar and mixed hardwoods provide a panorama of multicolored leaves in the fall.", "lon": -96.149096, "trail_id": 19353, "city": "Bonham", "rating": 0.0, "lat": 33.546767, "state": "Texas", "name": "Bonham State Park"}
