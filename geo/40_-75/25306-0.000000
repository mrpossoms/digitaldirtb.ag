{"rating": 0.0, "state": "Pennsylvania", "name": "Tohickon Valley Park", "city": "Point Pleasant", "lat": 40.436245, "trail_id": 25306, "lon": -75.075013, "description": "The Tohickon Creek actually begins in Richland Township but for purposes of this article, we will focus on the stretch from the dam at Lake Nockamixon to Point Pleasant. This comprises 11.5 miles with alternating bands of Triassic shales, sandstones, and argillites, which line its bed. It has been identified and may one day be classified as a National Natural Landmark. The stream is currently classified as a (CWF) cold water fishery and is stocked with trout each year. Surveys conducted by the Bucks County Audubon Society state that the creek valley houses 82 bird species, including 4 species of rare concern and 10 rare breeders."}
