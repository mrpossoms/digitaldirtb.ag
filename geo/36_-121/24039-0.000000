Other stories are found in diaries or letters from explorers long-ago.  Visitors to the Fort Ord National Monument are able to re-trace the steps of Juan Bautista de Anza's Expedition - an overland expedition from Sonora, Mexico to Alta California 1774-1776.  He led about 240 people from northern Mexico, through Arizona, and into central California.  Anza's route was recreated by comparing geographic features and archeological sites to details described in his diary."}
