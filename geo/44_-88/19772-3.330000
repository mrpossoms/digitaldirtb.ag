{"description": "High Cliff State Park is the only state-owned recreational area on Lake Winnebago, Wisconsin's largest lake. The park gets its name from the limestone cliff of the Niagara Escarpment, which parallels the eastern shore of Lake Winnebago. The magnificent 12-foot statue of Winnebago Indian Chief Red Bird, standing high on a huge granite rock, overlooks the lake and is a popular destination in the park.", "lon": -88.282446, "trail_id": 19772, "city": "Sherwood", "rating": 3.33, "lat": 44.162671, "state": "Wisconsin", "name": "High Cliff State Park"}
