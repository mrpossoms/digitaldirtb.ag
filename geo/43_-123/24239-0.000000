{"rating": 0.0, "state": "Oregon", "name": "North Umpqua Trail - Swiftwater Trailhead", "city": "Roseburg", "lat": 43.216505, "trail_id": 24239, "lon": -123.341738, "description": "The Swiftwater Trailhead is the western terminus of the 79 mile long North Umpqua Trail. The trailhead parking area south of the Swiftwater Bridge has interpretive panels, garbage cans, a small picnic area, and a vault restroom. The Tioga segment of the North Umpqua Trail is 7.8 miles long from Swiftwater trailhead east to the Tioga Bridge. The Swiftwater segment of the North Umpqua Trail is 8 miles long and stretches from the Tioga Bridge to the Wright Creek Bridge. The trail is open to anglers, hikers, mountain bikers, and is closed to all motor vehicle use including ATVs and motorcycles. The trail is steep in sections and is therefore considered moderate. There are no facilities for equestrian users, however, some do enjoy the rugged and challenging forested ride. Swifwater Trailhead and the North Umpqua Trail between the trailhead and Deadline Falls are fully accesible to people with disabilities. Past that, the steep trail and numerous rocks and roots make the rest of the trail not accessible to people who use wheelchairs."}
