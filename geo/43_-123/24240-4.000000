{"description": "Visit one of Oregon's most beautiful rivers. Renowned for outstanding salmon and steelhead fishing and exhilarating whitewater challenges, the North Umpqua River offers an ideal setting for many recreational pursuits. The North Umpqua provides the right challenge for all types of rafters and kayakers, from placid Class I waters to roaring Class IV rapids. The best months to raft are May, June, and early July. Later in the summer as the water flows decrease, boaters test their rock-maneuvering skills as the rapids become more technical. Almost 34 miles of the North Umpqua have been designated as a Wild and Scenic River and this section has been set aside exclusively for fly-fishing. The 79 mile long North Umpqua Trail parallels the river and offers visitors challenging hiking and mountain biking experiences.", "lon": -123.341738, "trail_id": 24240, "city": "Roseburg", "rating": 4.0, "lat": 43.216505, "state": "Oregon", "name": "North Umpqua Wild and Scenic River"}
