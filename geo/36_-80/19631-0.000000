The park parallels the scenic and historic New River for 40 miles and passes through four counties. The trail's gentle slope makes it great for visitors of all ages to hike, bike and ride horseback. Several places in the park provide horse, canoe and bike rentals, boat launches and gift shops. Fishing is popular, and primitive camping sites dot the trail. The park hosts a horse arena, and guided horseback trips are available. There are access points to the trail at Allisonia, Cliffview, Draper, Foster Falls, Fries, Galax, Ivanhoe and Xaloy (near Pulaski). Horse trailer parking is available at Allisonia, Cliffview, Draper, Fries, Foster Falls and Xaloy."}
