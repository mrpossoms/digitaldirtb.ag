{"rating": 0.0, "state": "California", "name": "Garin/Dry Creek Pioneer Regional Parks", "city": "Hayward", "lat": 37.62799, "trail_id": 22972, "lon": -122.029191, "description": "The Garin Barn Visitor Center is open weekends between Memorial Day and Labor Day from 11:30 a.m. to 6:00 p.m. It is designed to aide in interpretive programs and for the enjoyment of the casual visitor. The Visitor Center displays artifacts from the ranching and farming history of the Hayward area. There is a blacksmith shop, a tool shop and several ranching-related displays to explore. An interesting collection of antique farm machinery outside the barn augments the display. Meyers Cottage was a popular summer home of Edith, Mildred, and Jeanette Meyers, three sisters of Alameda who were very involved in local charities and fundraisers during the early and mid 1900s. The sisters also owned the 1,200-acre Dry Creek Ranch, which was donated to the Park District in 1979 and later opened as Dry Creek Regional Park. Upon the passing of the last surviving Meyers sister, the Meyers Cottage and its garden was also donated to the Park District. The Park District plans to eventually open the cottage for receptions, weddings, and similar events, and it will also house a small visitor center."}
