{"description": "Lake Chabot Reservoir was built in 1874-75 as a primary source of water for the East Bay. The 315-acre lake was closed to recreation for 91 years. Legislation passed in the 1960s opened the lake for controlled recreational uses. Currently, the lake serves as a standby emergency water supply. For this reason, visitors are asked to observe certain necessary regulations to keep the waters pure.", "lon": -122.130102, "trail_id": 22980, "city": "Castro Valley", "rating": 4.0, "lat": 37.730672, "state": "California", "name": "Lake Chabot Regional Park"}
