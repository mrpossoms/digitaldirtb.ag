{"rating": 0.0, "state": "Mississippi", "name": "Great River Road State Park", "city": "Rosedale", "lat": 33.843171, "trail_id": 17811, "lon": -91.032538, "description": "Park temporarily closed until further notice. Situated inside the Mississippi River levee and bordered by the majestic river on its western edge, Great River Road State Park offers magnificent views of the 'Father of Waters' from a setting unmatched in natural beauty. The focal point of the park is a seventy five-foot high overlook tower, which provides panoramic views of the Mississippi River as well as being the ideal spot for a picnic. The park is named for the Great River Road, a scenic parkway that follows the Mississippi from its beginning as a small Canadian creek to its end at the Gulf of Mexico."}
