{"description": "Ascending into the southern end of the Cerbat Mountains, Badger Trail meanders through scenic Mohave Desert vegetation and interesting granitic rock outcroppings. The route gains almost 1,100 feet in elevation over its 3.2 mile length and joins with Castle Rock Trail at the upper terminus. With a consistent 8 percent grade, you will find this route moderately strenuous to hike or bike. At several locations along the trail, you will be treated to spectacular view of the surrounding valleys and mountains. Weather conditions are most comfortable between the months of September and May, although early-morning use during the summer can be pleasant as well.", "lon": -114.053006, "trail_id": 23975, "city": "Kingman", "rating": 0.0, "lat": 35.189443, "state": "Arizona", "name": "Badger Trail"}
