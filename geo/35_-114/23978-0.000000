{"rating": 0.0, "state": "Arizona", "name": "Cherum Peak Trail", "city": "Kingman", "lat": 35.189443, "trail_id": 23978, "lon": -114.053006, "description": "The route climbs steadily to gain about 700 feet of elevation over the first two miles, passing through patches of pinyon pine woodland and Arizona chaparral bush.  At about the two-mile mark, you will be high on the crest of the Cerbat Mountains, with spectacular panoramic views of the Black Mountains to the west, and the Music Mountains to the east.  Hikers continuing on from this point will find that the trail ties into a litttle-used jeep road about one-quarter mile later.  Following the jeep road for a short distance, you will be just below Cherum Peak summit.  The trail once again becomes a single track at this point, leading to the summit.  Horses and mountain bikes are not recommended on the last 1/4 mile of the trail leading to the peak."}
