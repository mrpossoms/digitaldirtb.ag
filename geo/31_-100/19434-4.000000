{"description": "San Angelo State Park is located on the shores of O.C. Fisher Reservoir, which was completed by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers in 1952 for flood control on the North Concho River. The park, adjacent to the city of San Angelo in Tom Green County, is an oasis of quality outdoor recreation in an area of West Texas known as Concho Country. It was leased by the Texas Parks and Wildlife Department and opened to the public May 1, 1995. The property contains 7,677 acres, most of which will remain undeveloped. Park redevelopment to its full recreational potential is expected to take a number of years. In the meantime, a wide range of facilities is available.", "lon": -100.536258, "trail_id": 19434, "city": "San Angelo", "rating": 4.0, "lat": 31.468302, "state": "Texas", "name": "San Angelo State Park"}
