{"description": "Located along the Susquehanna River valley with its heavy forest cover and rocky terrain, Susquehanna State Park offers a wide variety of outdoor recreational opportunities as well as points of historical significance. The park is home to some of the most popular mountain biking trails in Maryland and the river itself beacons fishermen and boaters alike. Susquehanna State Park also contains a very family friendly campground with traditional campsites and cabins. History buffs will be drawn to the restored Rock Run Historic Area with its working grist mill, the Carter-Archer Mansion, Jersey Toll House and the remains of the Susquehanna Tidewater Canal. The river offers excellent fishing opportunities, including pike, perch, and bass for shoreline anglers or boating anglers who launch from the Lapidum Boat Ramp.", "lon": -77.064302, "trail_id": 17066, "city": "Havre de Grace", "rating": 4.0, "lat": 41.222944, "state": "Maryland", "name": "Susquehanna State Park"}
