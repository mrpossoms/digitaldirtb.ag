{"description": "If you put together the perfect state park in your mind, it would be Devil's Den. Nestled in picturesque Lee Creek Valley in the Ozark Mountains, Devil's Den is one of Arkansas's five, original state parks built by the Civilian Conservation Corps in the 1930s. In these beloved parks, the rustic-style facilities mirror the rugged natural beauty that surround them. In the heart of Devil's Den, a rock dam spans Lee Creek forming Lake Devil. This eight-acre lake is a serene setting for fishing, canoeing, kayaking, and pedal boating.", "lon": -94.248717, "trail_id": 14584, "city": "West Fork", "rating": 3.0, "lat": 35.769543, "state": "Arkansas", "name": "Devil's Den State Park"}
