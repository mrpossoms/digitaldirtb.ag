{"rating": 0.0, "state": "Oregon", "name": "Klamath Wild and Scenic River", "city": "Klamath Falls", "lat": 42.688892, "trail_id": 24236, "lon": -121.609842, "description": "The Upper Klamath River has a lengthy use season thanks to the steady water releases from the J.C. Boyle Dam and Powerhouse. PacifiCorp, a large regional utility company, operates the dam and powerhouse project to generate hydroelectric power. Rafters and kayakers get to ride the water downstream of the powerhouse. It is technically possible to run the river year-round, but optimum rafting and kayaking weather occurs mostly from May through October."}
