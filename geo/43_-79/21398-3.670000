{"description": "This pastoral, all-season oasis between Burlington and Oakville offers a place to unwind and step back in time. View living history demonstrations in an 1890s farmhouse. Take the children to the playbarn to pet the animals or romp in the outdoor playground. Camp overnight, swim in a huge outdoor pool, stroll along nature trails, and pedal your bicycle. In winter, skate outdoors, go tobogganing and cross-country skiing. The day use and campground areas in this park are separate; each has its own entrance.", "lon": -79.769011, "trail_id": 21398, "city": "Oakville", "rating": 3.67, "lat": 43.407044, "state": "Ontario", "name": "Bronte Creek Provincial Park"}
