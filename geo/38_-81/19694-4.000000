{"description": "Located just seven miles south of Charleston, West Virginia, Kanawha State Forest is in close proximity to the heavily populated Kanawha Valley and is a recreational haven. Some of the state's most popular picnic areas are here, along with significant hiking, mountain biking, and cross-country skiing opportunities. A playground attracts families during the summer season and the fully equipped campground is one of the few in the Charleston area.", "lon": -81.64168, "trail_id": 19694, "city": "Charleston", "rating": 4.0, "lat": 38.281858, "state": "West Virginia", "name": "Kanawha State Forest"}
