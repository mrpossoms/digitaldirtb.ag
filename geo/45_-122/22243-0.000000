{"rating": 0.0, "state": "Oregon", "name": "Oaks Bottom Wildlife Refuge", "city": "Portland", "lat": 45.47514, "trail_id": 22243, "lon": -122.653149, "description": "Oaks Bottom is a floodplain wetland located along the east bank of the Willamette River. Part of the park is built on a sanitation landfill consisting of 400,000 cubic feet of construction waste material layered with soil. The City of Portland acquired the landfill property from the Donald M. Drake Company at the beginning of 1969 to block its development as an industrial park. The area was believed, at the time, to be one of the few remaining marshland areas in Portland, and local residents were strongly opposed to its development as industrial property."}
