{"description": "This park is named for its centerpiece, a lake which often is so calm that not a ripple marks its surface. The lake reflects a wooded shoreline with cliffs up to 50 feet high, a swimming beach, and wetlands that are home to a variety of wildlife. The park's 2,200 acres includes several picnic areas, wooded campsites, summer rentals, and a cabin for people with disabilities.", "lon": -89.82, "trail_id": 19797, "city": "Baraboo", "rating": 0.0, "lat": 43.565, "state": "Wisconsin", "name": "Mirror Lake State Park"}
