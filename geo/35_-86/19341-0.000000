{"description": "Tims Ford State Park, located on the Tims Ford Reservoir in the rolling hills of southern middle Tennessee, is an outstanding recreational area and fishing paradise. Long before the construction of Tims Ford Dam on the headwaters of the Elk River, the area was used extensively by the Indians as a hunting and fishing territory. Archaeological excavations uncovered numerous artifacts and occupational sites, indicating that man had occupied the area as much as 10,000 to 12,000 years ago.", "lon": -86.256084, "trail_id": 19341, "city": "Winchester", "rating": 0.0, "lat": 35.221292, "state": "Tennessee", "name": "Tims Ford State Park"}
