Part of the &quot;Locks to Lakes Corridor,&quot; the trail is approximately 11 miles long and follows an off-road corridor along the lake and through lakeside communities. The existing &quot;interim&quot; soft-surface trail provides excellent views of the lake and Cascade foothills, and is popular with off-road bicyclists, joggers, walkers and other users. The ELST will be upgraded in phases to become a fully paved facility with soft-surface shoulders."}
