{"description": "The Interurban Trail links Tukwila, Kent, Auburn, Algona, and Pacific along a near-straight 14 mile-long alignment following the historic Interurban Rail Line. To the north, the Interurban starts at an intersection with the Green River Trail at Fort Dent Way near Fort Dent Park. The trail crosses over the Green River and under Interstate 405, then turns straight south within the Puget Sound Energy powerline corridor. The alignment crosses a wide variety of landscapes and provides views of many regional activities. Following the BNSF railroad south, the landscape passes through historic industrial areas and suburban lands before crossing the broad Green River Valley. The trail provides access to the Southcenter area, Renton Junction, downtown Kent, Emerald Downs in Auburn, and the communities of Algona and Pacific. The trail currently ends at 3rd Avenue SW in Pacific. A second southern intersection with the Green River Trail occurs at Kent's Foster Park, providing the possibility of an Interurban-Green River Trail recreational loop through the Green River Valley. The Interurban is an excellent north-south off-road, nonmotorized route that is popular with commuters between south King County and employment centers in Auburn, Kent, Tukwila, Renton, and Seattle. Access and parking are provided at numerous locations along the trail.", "lon": -122.230485, "trail_id": 22478, "city": "Bellingham", "rating": 0.0, "lat": 47.880164, "state": "Washington", "name": "Interurban Trail"}
