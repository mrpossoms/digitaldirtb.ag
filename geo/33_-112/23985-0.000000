{"description": "Brittlebush Trail is a nearly level, 6-mile route through the heart of the 63,200-acre North Maricopa Mountains Wilderness. The North Maricopa Mountains are a jumble of long ridges and isolated peaks separated by extensive, saguaro-studded bajadas and wide desert washes. Cholla, ocotillo, prickly pear, paloverde, ironwood, and Mexican jumping bean complement the thick stands of saguaro to form classic Sonoran Desert vistas. Commonly seen wildlife include desert mule deer, javelina, desert bighorn sheep, coyote, desert tortoise, and numerous varieties of lizards and birds. During wet spring months, the hillsides adjacent to the trail are awash with brilliant yellow blooms of the brittlebush.", "lon": -112.074037, "trail_id": 23985, "city": "Phoenix", "rating": 0.0, "lat": 33.448377, "state": "Arizona", "name": "Brittlebush Trail"}
