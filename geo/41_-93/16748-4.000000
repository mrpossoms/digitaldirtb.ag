{"description": "&quot;Ahquabi&quot; is a Sauk and Fox word meaning &quot;resting place,&quot; and it is a fitting name for this scenic 770-acre park. The park site was recommended by &quot;Ding&quot; Darling, nationally known Iowa political cartoonist and conservationist, and was dedicated in 1936. Many of its structures were constructed by the Civilian Conservation Corps (CCC) in the 1930's and remain available for the enjoyment of park visitors.", "lon": -93.5824, "trail_id": 16748, "city": "Indianola", "rating": 4.0, "lat": 41.285148, "state": "Iowa", "name": "Lake Ahquabi State Park"}
