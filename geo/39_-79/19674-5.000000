{"description": "Blackwater Falls State Park is named for the falls of the Blackwater River whose amber-colored waters plunge five stories then twist and tumble through an eight-mile long gorge.\r\n\r\nThe &quot;black&quot; water is a result of tannic acid from fallen hemlock and red spruce needles. The falls are one of the most photographed sites in West Virginia.\r\n\r\nBlackwater lodge, cabins and restaurant are open year-round and welcome visitors to enjoy winter sled riding, spring greening, cool summer evenings, and autumn foliage.\r\n\r\nYou'll find good food, comfortable accommodations, and WiFi access if you must stay in touch while you're relaxing at Blackwater Falls.", "lon": -79.489894, "trail_id": 19674, "city": "Davis", "rating": 5.0, "lat": 39.107258, "state": "West Virginia", "name": "Blackwater Falls State Park"}
