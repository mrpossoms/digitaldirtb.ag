Marshall, MI
------------

I started off my trip driving from Grand Rapids, to Marshall Michigan. I had found a trail there named 'the dump', since part of it had been built over an old landfill or something of the like. The trail builders really owned it though. As soon as I rolled into the parking lot another dude named Bruce also rolled up. We bullshit for a little while, and ended up riding with each other. The dump was appropriately named, and incorporated broken pavement, concrete chunks, and other refuse into the trail as features. It had some flow to it, as well as some technical sections. A good part of it straddled a ravine and had you slaloming back and forth many times, giving it a roller-coaster feel.

Bruce and I then headed over to the local watering hole, Dark Horse Brewing. He gave me recommendations of different places to ride in Kansas City, he had lived there the past 5 years and recently moved back to Michigan. After which I retired to my van in the parking lot. I figured if anyone saw my ride in the lot, they'd figure someone had one too many, and opted out of a DUI. And from a sample size of 1; I seem to be right.
