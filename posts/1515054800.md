January
--------------

After spending the holidays in the great white north I returned to Nashville. Rearing to head further toward equatorial bliss. There had been a serious cold snap through most of the states. The morning I flew out it was 7 degrees in Grand Rapids. When I landed in Nashville, it was a glorious 32 degrees. Regardless! Warmer was an order.

I immediately drove from Nashville to Chattanooga, spent the night there (in yet another brewery lot). Then departed for Georgia the following morning. Not long after crossing the border I stopped for some fuel. It was a cold morning for Georgia (in the twenties), but the sun was shining and my spirits were up. I finished fueling up, sat down and buckled up, turned the key and... click... Nothing turned it again, to the same end. Dammit. I instinctively hopped out and started shuffling all my possessions around to get to the engine compartment. I had just had my starter replaced by a GR Volkswagen shop, so I didn't think that should be a problem. After lots of messing around, and testing electrical connections with frozen fingers I gave up. Electrically everything seemed totally fine. So I figured the starter itself had to be toasted. I frantically called around to different shops looking for someone who would A.) work on an old VW and B.) could see me in less than a month. After several failed attempts. I finally found a place called Marietta Sports Car that was willing to help me out as quickly as they could. The mechanic Danny was a super helpful guy and was able to get a new starter and swap it in under 24 hours! So after a night of AirBnB and hundreds of dollars at the shop later I was finally mobile again.

I drove all day and some of the night...  I made it all the way through the peach farms and vast country side and still wasn't out of Georgia. I ended up calling it quits in Valdosta it was well past dark, and I was tired. I crashed at the local Walmart and slept like a wee babe.

That morning I woke, extremely excited to make it to Florida. It was already quite warm that morning compared to what I had been accustomed to. So with a smile on my face, I started the van up... Or, well I turned the engine over at least. But it didn't start... "Seriously!?", I thought to myself After having just been stranded by mechanical problem I couldn't believe something else was amiss. It felt warm out. I didn't think cold temps could be the problem. I checked the weather to confirm. It was 40... 40?! I had never had issues getting started when it was 40... I sat there and thought for a while. "What the hell could be the problem?", I thought. "Wait... Maybe, just maybe... my glo-plugs are burned out. That would explain why it's been so difficult to get going in the cold.". That was the best explanation I could muster. "So if that's the case... What can I do?". I had a thought and ran into Walmart looking desperately for my solution. I emerged with gleaming glossy-blue torch. Now to try my ridiculous solution. I fired up the torch. My plan  was to warm the glo-plugs up with the torch and get them to a temperature high enough to start the engine. The problem was the injection lines were blocking the nozzle to most of the glo-plugs. Getting the torch in the spaces would have been next to impossible. But... there was one glo-plug that was within reach... So I went for it. I heated that little bastard up. Then quick ran over to the driver's seat and cranked the starter. Almost immediately it started up. The engine sounded like absolute shit. But it made sense. It was running on literally one cylinder. Moments later, I heard the other three follow suit and fire up too! Success!

Having gotten a late start I headed straight toward Tallahasse, my first stop in the 'Sunshine State'. The glo-plug issue was weighing heavily on my mind. So as soon as I got there, I grabbed some food and called around to auto parts stores. Trying to find someone who could get some new glo-plugs by the end of the day. NAPA, no dice. Autozone however, they had them in stock! No way! I raced over, bought them, and immediately started changing them in their parking lot. After several trips back into the store to buy weird wrenches, the deed was done, and I was good to go.

By that point, the day was mostly done. So as is my nature, I found the local watering hole and spent the evening there. This particular watering hole was called Proof Brewing. It was a cool place in an even cooler part of town. Proof was is an 'Art park' so it was surrounded by studios galleries and a pretty rad park. I chilled there for a while and just worked. The place was sweet, but the locals left a lot to be desired... Most of them I interacted with were assholes. I guess I'm not in the midwest any more.

I spent that night in Art Park, parked right outside the brewery. Once again, the fermented camouflage worked. I packed up my window insulation panels. Then headed to a local coffee roaster, 'Lucky Goat Coffee'. The baristas there were great, and the coffee was actually really good too. After that I headed to a local trail system called  'Lafayette Heritage Trail Park'. That place was a long desired treat. It had a bit of everything, dirt tabletops, drops and some woodwork. There was a fair amount of climbing too, which is uncharacteristic for Florida (so I had heard).

As an added bonus, there was a bike demo for Pivot out in the parking area. Naturally there were a bunch of rad humans congregated for it. One dude in particular, the Pivot rep, was also a vanner. Both professionally and for leisure. He travelled for Pivot, from shop to shop doing demos.

After I said my goodbyes, it was time to put some miles on the van. My friend Erica had planned to give me a whirlwind tour of the best trails in south west Florida, the first stop wasn't very south, or west. However, it is well renown as being some of the best riding the state had to offer, Santos. Santos is near a small city called Ocala, so I pointed the van south and made my way.

With another night at Wally-world under my belt, I worked in town for a bit. I was feeling anxious though, so I cut to the chase and went straight to the trailhead instead where I worked until Erica arrived.

The following week flew. Erica took me on a whirlwind tour of the trails of south western Florida. Every day we went somewhere new, and our outings cemented my perception of the state's riding style. Rooty, rocky rugged and technical, but with little to no elevation change. Erica was an area guide that everyone wished they had, she had each day planned out and was kind enough to let me stay at her place for the time I was there.

After that week of constant riding, Erica was set to travel to snowier landscapes in Colorado to ski. Thus, I was once again on my own. Luckily for me timing worked in such a way that I had an excuse to leave western Florida anyway. I so happened to have a few really good Friends in Ft. Lauderdale who had just finished a cruise. So again, I was on my way. I met them there, we caught up and they even let me crash in their hotel. Their flight left early that next morning.

For that week I resided on the east coast of the state, and got somewhat of a feel for the area. With that said, I'm not much of a fan of Miami. From the snapshot of the city that I gleaned, It's a mecca of road congestion, and materialism. Additionally it felt anxiety inducing for whatever reason. Not my style. Most of my time on the East coast I actually spent on this weird little Barrier island called Key Biscayne. Speaking of materialism... This place was littered with the most immaculate homes, cars, and residents. Another interesting attribute of the key was the fact that nearly everyone who lived there primarily spoke Spanish. It really felt like foreign country, bringing me back to my time in Peru. All that aside, the pace seemed slower, people more friendly and trails easily accessible so I stayed.

Directly to the north of Biscayne is Virginia Key, home to an ecological preserve and some pretty rad trails. The trails were really unique, primarily because of their creative use of hurricane damage. Rather than cutting-up down trees, and shored watercraft, they made them part of the ride experience. On top of that they had also built a lot of spooky wood and rock features.

After a week there I took Alligator alley back to the east side, and spent some time in the 'downtown' of Fort Meyers proper. Camping at the Walmart north of town and commuting back to the coffee shops and city center each day. Ft Meyers was fine, but I didn't love it. In retrospect, the place didn't have much of a soul to it. After that work week I headed north to where I spotted a cluster of trails on Trailforks, right up around a town called North Port. North Port wasn't much of a town at all, neither was its neighbor Venice, but for whatever reason I resonated with it. My first day there, I think I rode 3 different trails. The first was a dud, but the second two were sweet. I even nearly smoked a gator after coming around a bend.

After riding I went to a local bar. I had gotten in just in time, because rain was starting to come down. And hard too. I rolled in and saw a guy sitting there wearing a "Piggy's Revenge" shirt, a local mountain bike race that Erica had told me about. So of course I struck a conversation up with him. As it turns out, the guy, whose name is Randy, was responsible for the organization of that race and also was responsible for the existence of many of the area's trails. We talked bikes for a while, he even offered to let me camp out in front of his house which I eagerly accepted. He and his wife left for the evening and I hung around chatting with the bartender and the locals for some time. After a day like that, I had to stay for a while.

And I was glad I did too. I had been in the area for some time, I'm not exactly sure how long, when I started to notice another brother in rubber and steel rolling around the streets of Venice. A rusted brown and beige Vanagon. We were always going in different directions on 41 though... What a bummer. Some time later, I slow to a stop at a signal. Staring blankly, when I see motion off to my right. I look over, and sure enough. The Vanagon I had been seeing had just pulled up next to me, its occupant eagerly flashing the "peace" sign. It's so funny, when you meet someone who's also driving a Vanagon you both immediately have a bond.

I've never been a car person, so maybe this is true for Jeep, Subaru and other VW owners, but for some reason I'm inclined to think something about a Vanagon is different. The vehicle, being the old beast that it is, brings with it a host of issues and character building experiences every owner can relate to. Not to mention the joy and freedom one feels whilst cruising, windows down, wind blowing with no plan or care. You'll sleep wherever you are when the sun sets, and go wherever impulse wills at dawn. That frame of mind is what this odd, angular metal box attracts, and for that reason above all I think a bond is instantly forged.

He signaled to me to park across the street. I followed and met him at a beer store called Island Time. His name was Thom, Thom and I immediately started talking and looking each other rigs over, showing each other what work we've done and articulated the plans we have for future improvement. We talked for a while, over some freshly purchased beers. Of course we talked some about work some too. At hearing that I was a programmer, he mentioned his friend Shawn who was working on a project related to solar power who had the need for slinging of bits. Being right up my alley, I eagerly gave him my information, said goodbye and parted ways.
