Hello, World!
-------------

Hey, my name's Kirk. This is the record of my journey. On the month of May 2016 I finished paying off my school loans two weeks later I bought a '82 Volkswagon Vanagon. One of the many iconic 4-wheeled vehicle that VW made from the 1980's to the 1990's. She was clean, beautiful, navy blue. But never-the-less she was a real effin' project.

When I bought it the electrical system was really screwed up. You literally needed to go into the engine compartment, and jump the glow-plugs for 20 seconds. Then trip the starter solenoid to turn it over... On top of that, nothing worked aside from the windshield wipers. I had to fix all the indicator lights, rewire the cooling system. Rebuild the breaks, etc. And these were all simply the mechanical issues. I spent even more time remodeling the interior, building storage, adding lighting, power, solar, refrigeration, tinting and more. Needless to say, this all took a hell of a lot longer than I expected, and as a result. I didn't depart until December 2nd, 2017. Over a year after I bought the van initially.

My plan with this wonderful wheeled wagon was, and still is, to travel north America on a veritable mountain bike pilgrimage. Riding as much cool shit as possible whilst working remotely. These are my experiences, I hope you find them entertaining, and maybe even useful. Much love.
