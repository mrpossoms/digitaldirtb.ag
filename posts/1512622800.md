Louisville, KY
--------------

The following day I woke up to a fault displayed on the screen on my electric system's charge controller, 'Over Current'. Side note: a charge controller is a piece of equipment that is responsible for treating the batteries in an off-grid solar power system as fairly as it can. Over the day, cloud cover, obstructions and open sky all contribute to wildly differing power levels, so a charge controller seeks to control when and how the batteries get charged in which conditions. Mine however wasn't charging... I thought to myself, shit, this must be a short or something... I shut off each part of the system from the breaker box, but still nothing, same message. Eventually I cut the power from the batteries, it shut off. I reconnected it, and... nothing. Well, I guess I don't have power anymore. I didn't have time to deal with it, I was going to be heading to Louisville.

That morning the temperature had dropped significantly. It was in the high 20's when I woke up, so there wasn't a chance of the van starting without a block heater. Being an old finicky diesel, I knew she wouldn't start. I had to wait for the temp to get into the 30's and even so she was pissed! So the thing that was foremost in my mind was finding somewhere I could park for the night that had power. I decided the most reliable option was to find an AirBnB that had an outlet outside. Luckily I did! So after a few hours of driving I arrived. And went out for a quick bop on some local trails. They weren't anything to write home about, but they were dirt trails in the city. Even had a few jumps and berms. After that I took one of the best showers in my life, went out for some beers then hit the sack. That morning, I discovered that the outlet that I was depending on didn't even work... I talked to the AirBnB host and they told me I could park at their bike shop next door and plug in there, perfect! Once again, I waited for the temp to come up. This time it even got into the 40's then I rolled it over to the shop where an extension cord was waiting for me.

That evening after work, I called around looking for a battery charger hoping I could find something that I could rent. First I tried NAPA, then AutoZone. No luck neither of them rent out battery chargers. Finally I found a little hardware store maybe a half mile from where my van was parked. Excellent, I walked there found that they had a charger I could rent. Even better! I rolled it back to the van and started charging the batteries that I thought were surely dead. I started charging. I expected the charge controller, and all the systems to come up right away, but instead everything was totally dead. What the hell!? Typically an automotive charger charges at ~14 volts. However, I was reading 7 volts at the ends of the wires coming from my battery bank... Something was definitely wrong. I measured the voltage at the battery I had the charger connected to. 14v, ok so what gives? That's when I noticed a hanging wire. In my frantic stupidity the day before I had disconnected it, thinking it was connected to the amp for my audio system. Nope. It was connected to the other half of my battery bank, and the damn charge controller... So basically two the batteries had been disconnected, and were now imbalanced. One was 7v and the other was charged at about 12v. So I left them disconnected and start charging the lower of the two, so I could balance them a bit before I reconnected them. And sure enough. As soon as I connected that charger the whole van lit-up. Lights came on, charge controller spun up refrigerator turned on. She lives!

After consulting the charge controller's manual, I found that fault message I had seen on the screen could have just been rectified by resetting from a menu on the charge controller. After that it would have gone back to normal operation. Oh well, you live and you learn.
