Well! Two months later, I'm finally getting back on the saddle. To anyone who was reading my musings, I apologize for the lapse. I'm going to do my best to summarize the past few months!

After my brief stint in Louisville, I moseyed further south taking just back roads through the rest of Kentucky. The driving was easy, a little bit of snow but the roads stayed dry. Eventually I crossed the Tennessee, stopping in Nashville right in the heart. Downtown Nashville has a curious feel... Neon lights abound, lots of activity, but yet some how it seemed a bit hokey. I explored around a bit. And luckily found parts of the city that were more my speed. I had searched online and found a few local breweries whose parking lots looked poachable from a satellite view. However, such things require ground recon to confirm. Ideally I was looking for something that had outlets for my block heater. My first attempt was Tennessee Brew works, it had a good parking lot, but it was a bit exposed and lacked outlets. On to the next, Jackalope Brewing. This place had parking in the back. Nice and protected, with outlets included! Jackalope was a solid place to spend the evening, big and open with a mezzanine that you could watch live music from.

I eventually turned in, and slept in their parking lot. I felt a bit uneasy that night. Next door was a building that I believe was a warehouse for seafood, it seemed like every hour a heavy refrigerated truck would roll up, lights blasting, diesel engine roaring and doors slamming. I didn't oversleep, that's for sure. Never the less, it was a night unmolested.

I hung around Nashville for a few days, I really grooved on it. I had blue skies, sunny days and much more warmth than home would offer. I found a trail system called Percy Warner Park, and had a blast. The most interesting thing about taking a slow paced MTB trip is that you really get a sense of how the terrain changes from region to region. This trail had parts that I really couldn't do well, one rock garden specifically was pretty rough. It required a very different more dynamic, lower speed style of riding to keep upright. I attempted it a few times. Got part of it after watching a local shredder go through first. He and his father were out riding, they were both cool dudes, so I tagged along and rode the rest with them.

As it goes, I spent that evening yet another purveyor of fermentation. Fat Bottom Brewing. The bar tender was awesome, and made me feel super welcome. I hung out until close, chatting with her and her friends about everything under the sun, from travel to alien overlords. At the end of the night she gave me some goodies for free!

Shortly there after I flew out of the Nashville airport back to Michigan for the holidays.
