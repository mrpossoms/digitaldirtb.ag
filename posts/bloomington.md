Bloomington, IN
---------------

I made a simple breakfast in the lot, oatmeal and peanut butter, while I was waiting for my engine block to heat up. As soon as I was done and my stuff was stowed I was off on my way. I headed south through Fort Wayne, IN and then toward Bloomington. Where my friend Katie had offered to put me up for the night. Bloomington is very much a college town, home to Indiana University, but it also has a lot of character. The campus is distributed throughout the town, and many of the buildings have a distinctly gothic architecture, which gives the city a mixed old-world yet modern feel.

In addition to checking out the city, I had longed to visit the famous Brown County State Park. I didn't know that much about it. Only that it is highly praised. However with the hilly drive to the west trail head I started to get an inkling that it might be different from what I was used to. I rolled into the trail's lot and saw a bunch of dudes on enduro bikes. The lot was situated at the top of a steep hill overlooking hundreds of acres of woods. I thought I may have bitten off more than I could chew. Luckily I was wrong, and again, I managed to strike up a conversation with a rider named Todd. He had been riding this trail for over 10 years, and knew it like the back of his hand. He asked if I wanted to tag along with him, and with a 'hell yeah' we proceeded down the hill.

This first trail - Hobbs Hollow, was the most flowy, fun trail I think I had ridden. Being from lower Michigan, I knew nothing about downhill or anything close to it. We descended for what seemed like 20 minutes, table top after table top and berm after berm, and all perfectly smooth. I was grinning from ear to ear as I started to get the hang of it. We rode a similar trail for probably another 5 minutes. Then proceeded to some other parts of the park that were more conventional cross-country. Still fun, fast and flowy. We then ran into some other dudes, and picked up another rider, Justin. It was starting to get dark so we all headed up the hill back out the the parking lot.

Katie cued me into this closed down market that was right behind her house that she recommended I park in, so I did. I camped there for 2 nights. The first night an SUV rolled in late and parked on the opposite side of this old mini-bus that I was parked next to. I was a little sketched out at first, but it was fine. They were just doing the same thing I was, bandit camping in an abandoned lot. The second night I had been out at a few bars on my bike. When I got back to my van they were there again, but this time with a super rad old GMC RV too. I had picked up some beers earlier, and I thought to myself, "Shit, these guys have to be pretty cool". So I grabbed my brews and knocked on the RV door. Sure enough, they were super chill. It turned out they were helping to renovate the old market. It was to be turned into an Asian inspired club of sorts, and they were doing some of the contracting. We chatted late into the night about, damn near every topic you could imagine. Eventually I said good night, and retired to my home across the parking lot.
